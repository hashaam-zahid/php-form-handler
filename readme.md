### PHP Form Handler Library
The PHP Form Handler Library is designed to fortify form data processing by implementing robust security measures, including variable sanitization, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack prevention, and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) token management.

### Key Features
Variable Sanitization:

Prevents malicious code injection by filtering form input data to remove potentially harmful characters.

XSS Attack Prevention:
Utilizes PHP's filter library and HTML encoding techniques to defend against Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

CSRF Token Management:
Implements CSRF token generation and validation to safeguard against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

### Goal
The primary objective of this repository is to provide a secure and reliable PHP library for handling form submissions. It empowers developers to:

Safely process form input data by filtering and sanitizing variables.
Protect web applications from XSS vulnerabilities by filtering out malicious input.
Implement CSRF tokenization to ensure secure and authenticated form submissions.

## Features

- **Input Filtering:** Sanitize form input data to prevent malicious code injection.
- **Form Validation:** Validate form fields to ensure required data is present and in the correct format.
- **CSRF Protection:** Guard against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks using tokens.

## Setup
Use Xampp, Mampp any Server with start with 127.0.0.1

### Installation via Composer

1. Install the library using Composer:
    ```bash
    composer require hashaam-zahid/php-form-handler
    ```

2. Include the Composer autoloader in your PHP script:
    ```php
    require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
    ```

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hashaam-zahid/php-form-handler.git
    ```

2. Include the necessary files in your PHP project:
    ```php
    require_once 'path/to/vendor/autoload.php';
    ```

## Usage

Instantiate the `FormHandler` class and use its methods to process form submissions securely.

### Example:

```php
// Include autoload file
require_once 'path/to/vendor/autoload.php';

use FormHandler\FormHandler;

$formHandler = new FormHandler\FormHandler();

// Process form submission
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
    $postData = $_POST;

    // Filter form input data
    foreach ($postData as $key => $value) {
        $postData[$key] = $formHandler->sanitizeInput($value);
    }

    // Handle form submission
    $result = $formHandler->handleForm($postData);

    if ($result['success']) {
        // Form submitted successfully
        echo $result['message'];
    } else {
        // Form submission failed
        echo $result['message'];
    }
}
```
